\chapter{Illocutionary Forces}

In this section, we indicate illocutionary forces of triggers that were immediately identified as speech acts.
Each illocutionary force is depicted with their (potential) illocutionary point(s):

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		1) & Assertive \\
		2) & Commissive \\
		3) & Declarative \\
		4) & Directive \\
		5) & Expressive \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Multiple illocutionary points should be read as \emph{OR},
\eg Inform$_{14}$ can mean it is
	assertive,
	directive,
	or both assertive and directive.
